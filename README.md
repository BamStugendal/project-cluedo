# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This weekâ€™s project is to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo. With clickable decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room.

## The problem
When the project was forked, all the basic things like html and basic css code for the cards were already there. So I started with the javascript code, making the objects, arrays, and later used them in functions.
